# Plan.it

Trip Itinerary Planner! WIP at the moment, but hope to have it finished soon :)

## Introduction

Plan.it is an web application that aims to streamline the process of planning, sharing, and organizing trips. Inspired by my recent trip to Japan, and how I found there were a lack of free trip planning options available. Having to resort to a collaborative google doc, I thought that there had to be a better way to to things.

Featuring trip sharing, csv export options, and a cool route planner, try it out today!
